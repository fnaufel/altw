# altw: an RStudio addin to copy selection to clipboard

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

In my installation of RStudio, even with Emacs keybindings, I was not able to use `M-w` (i.e., `Alt-W`) for copying. 

`C-w` and `C-y` work fine for killing and yanking, respectively.

`altw` is an RStudio addin to copy the current selection to the clipboard. 

If there are multiple selections in the active document (made with multiple cursors), the `altw` concatenates them with `\n` as the separator before copying.

As any addin, it can be bound to a keyboard shortcut. 

Now I can use `M-w` to copy text to the clipboard, as in Emacs.


## Installation

You can install `altw` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("fnaufel/altw")
```

After installation, go to **Tools | Addins | Browse Addins...**, find `altw`, select it, and click on `Keyboard shortcuts` to bind it to your favorite key.


## Dependencies

This addin uses [the great `clipr` package](http://matthewlincoln.net/clipr/index.html). 

If you're using any distribution of GNU-Linux with X11, you need to have the [`xclip` program](https://github.com/astrand/xclip) installed.
